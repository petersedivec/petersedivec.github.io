* Well then, the Chick Weight App is the app for you

We did a detailed analysis of the available diets for raising chickens based on 
the following data set, ChickWeight. A synopsis of the dataset is available here

## What are you waiting for, Download today

Our app intuitively allows you to view a side-by-side comparison of two diets, 
and hence if you start collecting your own dataset and or are able to get diet
datasets from others you'll be able to load and compare more diets
